## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP. 

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- A regulated, Kenya Shilling–backed stablecoin enabling interoperable, programmable finance across Africa’s fintech ecosystem.
- The Digital Shilling (TD$) is a Kenya Shilling–denominated, fully-reserved stablecoin built to enable seamless, low-cost, and programmable settlements across the fintech ecosystem. Issued by the Association of Fintechs in Kenya (AFIK) — a consortium of 100+ fintechs. TDS will be developed as an open-source protocol leveraging Substrate, with interoperability to Polkadot, Cardano, and BNB Smart Chain networks.TDS will provide:
  - Stable, KES-pegged digital currency for fintech settlement and on-chain payments.
  - Validator governance by regulated fintechs.
  - Reserve audit oracles linking on-chain tokens to off-chain KES reserves.
  - Smart contract integration for programmable payments, escrow, and compliance.
- TD$ integrates as a Polkadot parachain module for stablecoin issuance, utilizing Substrate for:
  - On-chain minting/burning logic.
  - Cross-chain liquidity bridges (XCMP).
  - Oracles for reserve verification.
  - DID-based compliance integration..
- As Kenya’s leading fintech association, AFIK seeks to establish a trusted, industry-led digital currency, bridging traditional finance with decentralized systems — a first for Sub-Saharan Africa.

### Project Details

Technology Stack:
- Core Framework: Substrate (Polkadot SDK)
- Smart Contracts: ink! + Solidity (dual compatibility)
- Reserve Oracle: Polkadot Oracle Module (off-chain workers)
- Identity/Compliance: Polkadot DID Pallet + Atala PRISM integration
- Storage: IPFS / Filecoin for audit proofs
- Validator Governance: AFIK member fintechs as distributed validators
- UI/UX Components:
  - Web dashboard for fintechs to mint/redeem tokens and view reserves
  - API layer for third-party fintech integrations (GraphQL/REST)
  - Transparency dashboard displaying live reserve attestations
- The project is:
  - Not a speculative crypto asset or ICO.
  - Not designed for retail speculation.
  - Not a replacement for CBDC, but complementary to existing monetary systems.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Position within Polkadot Ecosystem: TD$ introduces a real-world, fiat-backed stablecoin use case into the Polkadot network, creating an interoperable bridge between traditional finance, DeFi, and regulatory institutions.
- Target Audience:
  - Fintechs, PSPs, and digital banks
  - Regulated crypto exchanges and wallets
  - Institutional validators and auditors
- Needs Addressed
  - Lack of interoperable settlement rails between fintechs
  - Absence of a transparent, KES-backed stablecoin
  - High cost and latency in mobile money settlements
- Evidence of Market Need
  - 91% mobile money penetration (CBK, 2025)
  - 8.5% crypto adoption rate (UNCTAD)
  - Over 45M digital wallet users in Kenya
  - AFIK represents 300+ fintechs eager for cross-platform settlement solutions
- USDC on Polkadot (Circle - private issuer) is a Global USD stablecoin with parachain compatibility. TD$ is different because:
  - Local Currency Focus: First Substrate-based stablecoin pegged to the Kenyan Shilling (KES).
  - Regulatory Alignment: Designed under Kenya’s upcoming Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) Bill, 2025.
  - Industry Governance: Issued and validated by the Association of Fintechs in Kenya (AFIK) — an umbrella body for 100+ fintechs.
  - Hybrid Architecture: Combines Substrate core modules with optional bridges to Cardano and BNB Smart Chain.
  - Real-World Financial Impact: Addresses fragmented mobile money ecosystems, providing transparent, interoperable digital settlement.
- eNaira (centralized CBDC) is a Government-issued digital currency pegged to the Nigerian Naira. and digital currency infrastructure. TD$ is different because:

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://grants.web3.foundation/docs/rfps) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> [!CAUTION]
> If any of your deliverables are based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**
